# CONSIDERATIONS
Following are some of the key considerations that I say are well worth the headache and effort required in order to integrate them into each aspect of a game development iteration.

**‚öôÔ∏è Mechanics**: The meat and bones of your game, it refers to the specific actions or interactions that encompasses the interaction, systems and behaviors  that will model the game experience. Some common mechanics include one or more of the following purposes: Provide Structure, Create Challenge, Enable Talent, Promote Fun.

Keep in mind that different mechanics feed into different *styles of game*, in a ideal world by balancing the game you could reach the perfect engagement between all kinds of players, but in reality you will find yourself having to choose a style over other.

**üîØ Progression**: Some way or another a game always need progression, it's crucial to engagement, motivation and retention of the players.

**üé¨ Fantasy**: Humans are story tellers by nature, take the next step and make your game magical by adding fantasy and immersion.

**üí£ Feedback**: For all actions it's necessary a reaction, something that no byond games take into account (sometimes because of engine limitations), making their game something dry, keeping players on the game not for the fun, but for the addiction and manipulation. Examples of feedback are visual cues, sounds and even text messages.

**‚û∞Gameplay Loop**: Recurring chains made of actions and feedbacks that define the temporal structure of the players' interactive experience. The progression is associated with Micro Loops, the narrative with Macro Loops, since the mechanics are what makes the existence of loops possible.

**‚ÜïÔ∏è Connection**: The *mechanics* must progress the character, the *progression* must lead to the completion of the narrative, the *narrative* must be reflected in the mechanics.

**‚öñÔ∏è Balancing**: The art of fine-tuning mechanics, progression, narrative, and feedback to ensure the experience is challenging yet fair.
